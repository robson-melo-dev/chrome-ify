# REACT CHROME EXTENSION BOILERPLATE

## INSTALLATION
Clone the repository and run <code>npm install </code> to install all dependencies.

## BUILD SCRIPTS
### <code>npm run dev </code>
Build the project on the dev mode and rebuild it each time you save any change on the files of the project.

### <code>npm run build </code>
Build the project on the production mode with everything ready.


## SOME TIPS
The project is ready to work with a <code>popup.html</code>, <code>popup.js</code> and the <code>manifest.json</code>. If you need to add other scripts like background or content script, you must remember to add the entry points in the <code>webpack.config.js</code> and also the permissions on the <code>manifest.json</code> in the <code>public</code> folder.
The project uses React and JavaScript.
Feel free to use this boilerplate and improve whatever is necessary.
